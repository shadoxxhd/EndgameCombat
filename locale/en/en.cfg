[mod-setting-description]
space-plasma=This gates the high-end plasma turrets behind the space science and by extension the rocket silo.
space-nukes=This gates the high-end nuclear shells behind the space science and by extension the rocket silo.
deconstruct-flesh=Automatically marks drops from alien death for robot deconstruction after a configurable delay.
deconstruct-flesh-timer=The length of time (in seconds) between an alien dropping an item and the item being marked for deconstruction. Shorter times clear items faster but increase the risk of robots flying into regions still packed with enemies.
radiation-timer=The length of time (in seconds) that radiation from a neutron bomb lasts.
crated-ammo-boost=The per-bullet damage boost (in %) of crated ammo over its consituent. Clamped to within [5,100]%.
rotting-flesh=If enabled, alien tissue kept in player or vehicle inventories gradually degrades, encouraging logistics to carry it to storage (where it lasts forever).
flesh-unit-drops=If false, Alien Tissue will only be dropped from spawners and worms. Be warned that this makes it effectively alien artifacts, which were removed from the base game due to the fact that they cannot be automated and must be manually acquired.
render-quality=Ranges from 1 to 3 inclusive, where 3 is max (and default) quality. Lowering this will reduce the visuals on some structures.
super-biters=If enabled, makes the green behemoth biters have 5x more health, and adds some laser resistance. Designed to make the lightning turret more desirable against them.
low-ammo-warning=When a turret with ammo has less than this many rounds left (each magazine item is worth 10 rounds), it will raise a "low ammo" alarm. One third that amount will raise a "critical ammo" alarm. Note that it takes 3-4 basic rounds to kill one small biter. Note: For ammo worth a lot more than 10 rounds, the warnings will likely trigger based on stack size instead: Three or fewer will trigger a low-ammo alarm, and one will trigger a critical alarm.
continue-alarms=Whether the alarms should be repeated as long as the triggering condition remains true, as opposed to playing once when it becomes true then falling silent.
smarter-alarms=Whether to base "low ammo" alarms on the total dealable damage by a turret, compared against the evolution factor, instead of just ammo amount - marginally more expensive to calculate, but this only matters in bases with thousands and thousands of turrets. This overrides the threshold option.
napalm-trees=With this enabled, trees in the range of a napalm shell will catch fire. Disable this if you want to be able to use them without causing forest fires.
